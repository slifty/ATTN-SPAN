==Points of Feedback==
"My main question is this: what's the use model? Who do we expect to
use it and what will they want? I can imagine it being very helpful
for true politicial junkies, professional operatives, etc., but
suspect the use case for the average citizen is slightly thinner.
Maybe the appropriate target is for activists focused on specific
issues, helping them comb through masses of footage to find mentions
of the issues they care about. Or for congresscritters themselves,
making it possible to index their appearances and package them to
communicate with constituents?"

"What about designing for designers-- making a web service with an easy to use API and recruit people to do things with it?

Is there a TheyWorkForYou equivalent in the US?

The C-Span view on Congress is itself an interesting thing to highlight and question, what with the fixed cameras, etc. If C-Span material were made searchable and made available by feed, it might be possible to unlock the creativity of others to fill in that picture in valuable ways. (though Swartz's caveats apply, I believe)"
